Random Relation Matrix Generator and Verifier

Overview-
A C program that generates random relation matrices, verifies their mathematical properties, and logs both the relations and the computation times.

Features -
Generates n random relation matrices with random dimensions.
Verifies the following properties:
Symmetry
Anti-symmetry
Transitivity
Equivalence relation
Function check
Logs:
Matrices in relations.txt
Verification results and times in times_and_properties.txt

File Outputs
relations.txt: Contains the generated matrices.
times_and_properties.txt: Logs time (in ms) and property verification results.
